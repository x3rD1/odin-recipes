        <h3 class="line">Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="list">
                <li>3/4 cup white vinegar</li>
                <li>1/2 cup low sodium soy sauce (or tamari)</li>
                <li>8 cloves garlic, minced</li>
                <li>1/2 tsp black peppercorns</li>
                <li>2 bay leaves</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp brown sugar</li>
                <li>3 lbs boneless skinless chicken thighs, fat trimmed</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp canola oil</li>
                <li>4 green onions, thinly sliced</li>
                <li>Steamed rice, for serving</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="line">Directions</h3>
            <ol class="list">
                <li>In a large bowl, combine the vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, peppercorns, bay leaves and brown sugar. Add the chicken and toss to coat.
                    <p class="inline">Cover the bowl and place it in the refrigerator for at least one hour, and up to three.</p></li>
                <li>In a large skillet over medium-high heat, warm the canola oil until glistening.
                    <p class="inline">Add the chicken (letting as much marinade drip off as possible) to the pan. Brown the chicken thighs on both sides, about 6 minutes total.</p></li>
                <li>Add the remaining marinade to the skillet and bring to a boil. Lower the heat to medium or medium low to maintain a heavy simmer for 10 minutes.
                    <p class="inline">Flip the chicken thighs. Simmer, stirring occasionally, until the sauce has reduced by half and is beginning to thicken, about 10 more minutes.</p>
                    <p class="inline">When the chicken thigh reads 165Â°F on an instant-read thermometer, remove from the heat.</p></li>
                <li>Serve the chicken thighs over cooked rice, sprinkled with green onions.</li>
